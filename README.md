Lightseek is a starter WordPress theme we use at [iSeek](http://www.iseek.ie/).

## Installation

Lightseek requires [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

First install the node dependencies:

``` npm install ```

Then build the styles:

``` gulp ```

The default build prepares a minified, production-ready CSS.

For a faster compilation process (not minified), you can use:

``` gulp dev ```

You can also watch files for changes. Watch task uses dev mode:

``` gulp watch ```
